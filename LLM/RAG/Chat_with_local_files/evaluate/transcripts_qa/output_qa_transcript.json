    "answer": "Answer:\nApache Kafka is an event streaming platform used for data platforms, event-driven architectures, and microservices [1]. It combines capabilities to publish (write) and subscribe to (read) streams of events, store streams of events reliably, and process streams of events as they occur [1]. Kafka is a distributed system consisting of servers and clients that allows you to write distributed applications and microservices that read, write, and process streams of events in parallel [1], [2]. An event, also called a record or message, records the fact that \"something happened\" and has a key, value, timestamp, and optional metadata headers [2]. Kafka can be deployed on bare-metal hardware, virtual machines, and containers, on-premises, and in the cloud [1].\n\nReferences:\n[1] introduction (file:///C:/Users/Precision 3541/Documents/Github_projects/Experiments/Assesments/Ericsson/solution/v1/data/kafka/introduction.html)\n[2] introduction (file:///C:/Users/Precision 3541/Documents/Github_projects/Experiments/Assesments/Ericsson/solution/v1/data/kafka/introduction.html)",

Kafka Connect can ingest entire databases or collect metrics from application servers into Kafka topics, making the data available for stream processing with low latency. It can also export data from Kafka topics into secondary storage, query systems, or batch systems for offline analysis [1].\n\nKafka Connect features a REST API for submitting and managing connectors, automatic offset management, and distributed and scalable architecture [1], [3]. It supports both streaming and batch data systems [3]. Connectors come in two types: SourceConnectors, which import data into Kafka, and SinkConnectors, which export data from Kafka [2]. Connectors are responsible for breaking a job into tasks that can be distributed to workers; SourceTasks and SinkTasks copy subsets of data to or from Kafka [2].

    "prompt": "What will happen if some of my incoming records are in a wrong format or broken?",
    "answer": "Answer:\nWhen processing data with Spark, the behavior when encountering malformed or corrupted records depends on the configured mode. Here's a breakdown of the possible outcomes:\n\n*   **PERMISSIVE Mode**: In `PERMISSIVE` mode, Spark will attempt to parse as much of the record as possible. It puts the malformed string into a field (configured by `columnNameOfCorruptRecord`) and sets the malformed fields to `null` [4]. To keep corrupt records, you can set a string type field named `columnNameOfCorruptRecord` in your schema. If your schema doesn't include this field, the corrupt records are dropped [4].\n\n*   **DROPMALFORMED Mode**: In `DROPMALFORMED` mode, the entire corrupted record is ignored [1], [2], [3]. Note that this mode is unsupported in the JSON and XML built-in functions [1], [3].\n\n*   **FAILFAST Mode**: In `FAILFAST` mode, Spark will throw an exception immediately upon encountering a corrupted record [1], [2], [3].\n\nIt is important to note that for CSV data sources, the behavior can be influenced by `spark.sql.csv.parser.columnPruning.enabled`. When enabled (which is the default), Spark only parses the required columns, so corrupt records might differ based on the set of fields required [4].\n\nReferences:\n[1] sql-data-sources-json (file:///C:/Users/Precision 3541/Documents/Github_projects/Experiments/Assesments/Ericsson/solution/v1/data/spark/sql-data-sources-json.md)\n[2] sql-data-sources-csv (file:///C:/Users/Precision 3541/Documents/Github_projects/Experiments/Assesments/Ericsson/solution/v1/data/spark/sql-data-sources-csv.md)\n[3] sql-data-sources-xml (file:///C:/Users/Precision 3541/Documents/Github_projects/Experiments/Assesments/Ericsson/solution/v1/data/spark/sql-data-sources-xml.md)\n[4] sql-data-sources-csv (file:///C:/Users/Precision 3541/Documents/Github_projects/Experiments/Assesments/Ericsson/solution/v1/data/spark/sql-data-sources-csv.md)",

    "prompt": "Can I interactively query the state of an application using Kafka. Provide example.",
    "answer": "Answer:\nYes, Kafka Streams enables applications to be queryable, allowing you to leverage the state of your application from outside the application [1]. This is achieved through interactive queries, which involve both local and remote components [1, 3].\n\nFor example, consider a Kafka Streams application processing user events in a multi-player video game, and you want to retrieve the latest status of each user directly and display it in a mobile app [2]. To make the full state of your application queryable, you would:\n\n1.  Add an RPC layer (e.g., a REST API) to your application to enable network interaction with application instances, allowing them to respond to interactive queries [2]. Reference examples are available to help you get started [2].\n2.  Expose the RPC endpoints of your application's instances via the `application.server` configuration setting of Kafka Streams. This setting makes each instance discoverable by others, as RPC endpoints must be unique within a network [2].\n3.  In the RPC layer, discover remote application instances and their state stores, and query locally available state stores [3].\n\nTo query remote states for the entire app, you must expose the application\u2019s full state to other applications, including those running on different machines [4].\n\nReferences:\n[1] interactive-queries (file:///C:/Users/Precision 3541/Documents/Github_projects/Experiments/Assesments/Ericsson/solution/v1/data/kafka/streams/developer-guide/interactive-queries.html)\n[2] interactive-queries (file:///C:/Users/Precision 3541/Documents/Github_projects/Experiments/Assesments/Ericsson/solution/v1/data/kafka/streams/developer-guide/interactive-queries.html)\n[3] interactive-queries (file:///C:/Users/Precision 3541/Documents/Github_projects/Experiments/Assesments/Ericsson/solution/v1/data/kafka/streams/developer-guide/interactive-queries.html)\n[4] interactive-queries (file:///C:/Users/Precision 3541/Documents/Github_projects/Experiments/Assesments/Ericsson/solution/v1/data/kafka/streams/developer-guide/interactive-queries.html)",

    "answer": "Answer:\nLogistic regression is a popular method to predict a categorical response using Spark ML [1]. It is a special case of Generalized Linear Models that predicts the probability of outcomes [1]. Spark ML can be used for binary outcomes using binomial logistic regression, or for multiclass outcomes using multinomial logistic regression [1]. The `family` parameter is used to select between the two algorithms; if left unset, Spark will infer the correct variant [1].\n\nFor example, the following code illustrates how to load a sample multiclass dataset, split it into train and test, and use `LogisticRegressionWithLBFGS` to fit a logistic regression model [2]. The model is then evaluated against the test dataset and saved to disk [2].\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaPairRDD;\nimport org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaRDD;\nimport org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaSparkContext;\nimport org.apache.spark.mllib.classification.LogisticRegressionModel;\nimport org.apache.spark.mllib.classification.LogisticRegressionWithLBFGS;\nimport org.apache.spark.mllib.evaluation.MulticlassMetrics;\nimport org.apache.spark.mllib.regression.LabeledPoint;\nimport org.apache.spark.mllib.util.MLUtils;\nimport org.apache.spark.SparkConf;\nimport scala.Tuple2;\n\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class JavaLogisticRegressionWithLBFGSExample {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    SparkConf conf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"JavaLogisticRegressionWithLBFGSExample\");\n    JavaSparkContext jsc = new JavaSparkContext(conf);\n\n    // Load training data\n    String path = \"data/mllib/sample_multiclass_classification_data.txt\";\n    JavaRDD<LabeledPoint> data = MLUtils.loadLibSVMFile(jsc.sc(), path).toJavaRDD();\n\n    // Split data into training (60%) and test (40%).\n    JavaRDD<LabeledPoint>[] splits = data.randomSplit(new double[]{0.6, 0.4}, 11L);\n    JavaRDD<LabeledPoint> training = splits[0].cache();\n    JavaRDD<LabeledPoint> test = splits[1];\n\n    // Run training algorithm to build the model.\n    LogisticRegressionModel model = new LogisticRegressionWithLBFGS()\n      .setNumClasses(3)\n      .run(training.rdd());\n\n    // Save the model\n    model.save(jsc.sc(), \"target/tmp/javaLogisticRegressionWithLBFGSModel\");\n    LogisticRegressionModel sameModel = LogisticRegressionModel.load(jsc.sc(),\n      \"target/tmp/javaLogisticRegressionWithLBFGSModel\");\n\n    // Compute raw scores on the test set.\n    JavaPairRDD<Object, Object> predictionAndLabels = test.mapToPair(p ->\n      new Tuple2<>(model.predict(p.features()), p.label()));\n\n    // Get evaluation metrics.\n    MulticlassMetrics metrics = new MulticlassMetrics(predictionAndLabels.rdd());\n    double precision = metrics.precision();\n    System.out.println(\"Precision = \" + precision);\n\n    jsc.stop();\n  }\n}\n``` [2]\n\nReferences:\n[1] ml-classification-regression (file:///C:/Users/Precision 3541/Documents/Github_projects/Experiments/Assesments/Ericsson/solution/v1/data/spark/ml-classification-regression.md)\n[2] mllib-linear-methods (file:///C:/Users/Precision 3541/Documents/Github_projects/Experiments/Assesments/Ericsson/solution/v1/data/spark/mllib-linear-methods.md)",

    "prompt": "How does the Spark aggregate function work? Provide example.",
    "answer": "Answer:\nAggregate functions in Spark operate on a group of rows to calculate a single return value [3]. These functions perform calculations such as sum, average, counting, finding minimum/maximum values, standard deviation, and estimation [1]. Some aggregate functions also perform non-mathematical operations [1].\n\nHere's an example using SparkR to compute a histogram of waiting times:\n\n```r\n# We use the `n` operator to count the number of times each waiting time appears\nhead(summarize(groupBy(df, df$waiting), count = n(df$waiting)))\n## waiting count\n## 1      70     4\n## 2      67     1\n## 3      69     2\n# We can also sort the output from the aggregation to get the most common waiting times\nwaiting_counts <- summarize(groupBy(df, df$waiting), count = n(df$waiting))\nhead(arrange(waiting_counts, desc(waiting_counts$count)))\n## waiting count\n## 1      78    15\n## 2      83    14\n## 3      81    13\n```\nIn this example, `n()` is used to count the number of times each waiting time appears in the dataset [2].\n\nReferences:\n[1] sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-aggregate (file:///C:/Users/Precision 3541/Documents/Github_projects/Experiments/Assesments/Ericsson/solution/v1/data/spark/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-aggregate.md)\n[2] sparkr (file:///C:/Users/Precision 3541/Documents/Github_projects/Experiments/Assesments/Ericsson/solution/v1/data/spark/sparkr.md)\n[3] sql-getting-started (file:///C:/Users/Precision 3541/Documents/Github_projects/Experiments/Assesments/Ericsson/solution/v1/data/spark/sql-getting-started.md)",
