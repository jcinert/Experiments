    "step-1": "The standard CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.6.3 requires students to write narratives to develop real or imagined experiences or events using effective technique, relevant descriptive details, and well-structured event sequences.",
    "step-2": "The assessment must test the student's ability to write a narrative that includes effective techniques, relevant descriptive details, and a well-structured event sequence.",

    "context": "Maria had a morning routine that she followed every single day. She would start her day by waking up to the sound of her melodious alarm at 6:30 a.m. After quickly turning it off, she'd head to the kitchen where her mom would already have a steaming cup of hot chocolate waiting for her. Next, she would grab her toothbrush and toothpaste and head to the bathroom to brush her teeth. The bathroom mirror would be slightly fogged up from her older brother's hot shower, making her trace smiley faces on it before wiping it clean. Once she was ready, she'd head to her room to put on her favorite outfit: a blue shirt with white stars, and jeans that had a small rip on the knee which, according to her, gave it character. After getting dressed, she would sit at her desk and skim through her planner to prepare for the day ahead, occasionally jotting down notes in the margins.",
    "frq": "Write a narrative about Maria's morning routine from her perspective. Your narrative should have a beginning, middle, and end. Make sure to use effective narrative techniques, relevant descriptive details, and structure the events in a sequential manner."

Assistant answer: ```json{
    "step-1": "The Common Core State Standard CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.4.9 states that 4th-grade students should 'Draw evidence from literary or informational texts to support analysis, reflection, and research.'",

    "context": "The ocean covers more than 70% of Earth's surface and serves as home to a myriad of creatures, from microscopic plankton to massive whales. It also plays a crucial role in regulating the planet's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide. Coral reefs, often referred to as the 'rainforests of the sea,' host a variety of marine life and contribute to biodiversity. However, human activities like pollution, overfishing, and climate change are putting ocean ecosystems at risk. Notable efforts are being made to conserve this vital resource, including the creation of marine protected areas and public awareness campaigns.",
