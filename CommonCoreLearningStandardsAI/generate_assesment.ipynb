Next, she would grab her toothbrush and toothpaste and head to the bathroom to brush her teeth. The bathroom mirror would be slightly fogged up from her older brother's hot shower, making her trace smiley faces on it before wiping it clean. Once she was ready, she'd head to her room to put on her favorite outfit: a blue shirt with white stars, and jeans that had a small rip on the knee which, according to her, gave it character. After getting dressed, she would sit at her desk and skim through her planner to prepare for the day ahead, occasionally jotting down notes in the margins.\\\",\\n\\t\\\"frq\\\": \\\"Write a narrative from Maria's perspective about a particular morning where something unexpected happens during her routine.
